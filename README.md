# Quarter-round-operation-of-ChaCha20-algorithm
This repository contains the implementation and verification of the quarter-round operation from the ChaCha20 cryptographic algorithm. The quarter-round operation is a fundamental part of the ChaCha20 algorithm,
which is widely used in stream ciphers for secure encryption.

In this project:

The quarter-round operation is implemented using SystemVerilog for hardware verification.
A testbench is developed to verify the correctness of the operation using Jasper tool for formal verification.
The code includes a detailed verification environment that checks the accuracy of the transformation through different input cases.
This project demonstrates how digital design and verification techniques can be applied to cryptographic algorithms in hardware.
